## 🔍 Test Observations

### Auto-Assignment Intelligence
The system successfully matched tasks to agents based on capability keywords:
- "data-processing" task → assigned to Data Processor agent
- "reporting" task → assigned to Report Generator agent
- "validation" task → assigned to Quality Checker agent

### Event Propagation
All state changes properly triggered WebSocket events:
- Agent creation → `agent:created` event
- Status change → `agent:status-changed` event
- Task creation → `task:created` event
- Task assignment → `task:assigned` event
- Task completion → `task:status-changed` event

### Performance Consistency
Response times remained consistent across all tests, indicating:
- No memory leaks
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized algorithms
- Stable WebSocket connections

---

## 📝 Recommendations

### ✅ Strengths
1. Robust error handling
2. Fast response times
3. Reliable auto-assignment
4. Real-time updates working flawlessly
5. Clean API design

### 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add database persistence tests
2. Load testing (concurrent requests)
3. Stress testing (1000+ agents/tasks)
4. Authentication/authorization tests
5. Rate limiting tests
